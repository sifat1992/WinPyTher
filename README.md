The FLIR A400 is an advanced fixed-mount thermal camera intended for automation, research, and industrial monitoring. It offers flexible integration with external systems, real-time streaming via GigE/RTSP, and high-resolution infrared imaging. The A400 is perfect for tasks like condition monitoring, thermal inspection, process control, and research experiments because it is designed for continuous operation and network connectivity, unlike handheld thermal cameras.

This repository details a useful procedure for setting up the FLIR A400 on ROS2 (Linux/WSL2) and Windows (using FFmpeg). It covers ROS2 integration, dataset capture, live video streaming, and installation. The objective is to offer a practical, step-by-step manual, bridging the gap left by the paucity of official documentation and internet blogs.
